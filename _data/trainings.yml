  Title: API Attacks Beyond the OWASP API Top 10
  URL: /register/?id=sku_HOtty6RFWsLTAd
  SectionId: sku_HOtty6RFWsLTAd
  Description: "Let’s face it, APIs are running the world.  3rd party integrations are everywhere from social media communication to integrations 
    allowing services to share platforms and data.  As developers race to create platforms with greater connectivity and functionality, shortcuts are 
    taken, errors are made, specifications ignore – resulting in the release of insecure APIs.  No longer are front end services and frameworks enough 
    to protect the APIs from new world, high-speed attacks.<br>
    Over the last 20 years as a hacker, researcher, and educator I have worked with many organizations to help them stop high-speed attacks as well as 
    sophisticated fraudsters that are constantly on the lookout for the next venue to ply their trade.  In addition to case studies derived from actual 
    attacks I will show how I was able to attack a garage door opener API and via responsible disclosure create a much safer platform for Chamberlain 
    customers/users to control entry into their homes.<br>
    In this 8-hour class we will talk about API attacks my company has seen against different types of platforms and compare common real-world attack 
    types to the API Top 10.<br>
    We will look at taking apart Android API calls, utilizing an open-source APK disassembly tool, for mobile applications and understand the attack 
    surface available.  This tool will be distributed via a docker container so students should have the ability to run a docker.<br>
    From a web application standpoint we will learn how to analyze API calls, API parameters and how to utilize simple tools like cURL or your favorite 
    intercept proxy, to make calls against APIs and understand the workflow to test against a range of use cases such as Account Take Over, Inventory 
    Take Over/Seat Spinning, Inventory Take Over, etc.<br>
    Attackers often have tools at their disposal that target specific organizations, we will highlight these tools and how they work.<br>
    Finally, we will look at some Case Studies from various places that we have seen attacks occur and current attack campaigns that have thwarted the 
    efforts of many security practitioners and development staff.  We will have a cloud environment built allowing for newly minted API security 
    enthusiasts to try techniques and view their attacks and fingerprints in real time."

  Title: Continuous Compliance at DevOps speed

  SectionId: sku_HOtw118RzSkqiw
  Description: "Have you experienced the challenge of communicating and collaborating with Compliance teams being as clear as mud?<br>
    We've all been there. In this training session, we'll learn how to use CNCF OPA (Open 
    Policy Agent) and Chef Inspec to verify the Compliance status of cloud resources 
    against standards such as Cloud Security Alliance CCM (Cloud Security Matrix) and AWS 
    Security Maturity Roadmap so we can help break some of the communication barriers with 
    Compliance teams, as they get an immediate understanding of the compliance status of 
    products and services.<br>
    Compliance is a major driver for investing in security for most businesses, and with 
    the growing number of systems and applications managing compliance of thousands of 
    systems without automation is not practical and Compliance teams are under immense 
    pressure to ensure successful audit outcomes, as failure to be compliant, can have 
    significant business impact. With Compliance as Code we can increase the speed of 
    delivery, mitigate lack of resources and time by-using checks across applications, 
    provide faster feedback to engineers, scale to hundreds or thousands of systems and 
    make the whole process easily auditable.<br>
    In this training, we will learn how to create and verify the compliance checks, 
    integrate them into CI/CD platform and also how we can leverage the use of metadata to 
    tag resources with all the compliance checks and standards they're meeting as we deploy 
    them in our cloud accounts in order to enable both engineering and compliance teams to 
    have the visibility they require for assurance of their cloud security posture.<br>
    The participants will perform all hands-on exercises in our state of the art browser 
    based labs."

  Title: Server-Side Template Injection
  URL: /register/?id=sku_HOtwph5R3gBWJ0
  SectionId: sku_HOtwph5R3gBWJ0
  Description: "The world is constantly changing and way of doing activities are 
    continuously evolving. Earlier, injection was a word used to yield ‘remedy’ from 
    threats but in these modern times of predominantly ongoing cybercrimes, that’s the 
    same word causing ‘tragedy’ to people globally. One such grueling kind of it is the 
    topic that I’m going to brief out right here named as 'Server Side Template Injection.'<br>
    An injection attack that happens due improperly sanitization of user inputs through a 
    template at the server side is called SSTI. This injection attack is more dangerous 
    from both developer’s and security professional point of view as it can execute native 
    functions from the user defined template. An example of a malicious expression could 
    be {{system('whoami')}}, which will execute the whoami system command. Thus, this 
    template injection attack can even lead to a Remote Code Exploitation. Many times, 
    it can also compromise the entire web server.<br>
    Isn’t this attack a nightmare for developers and security professionals? Without a 
    doubt, it is!<br>
    Hence to caution people on this, my presentation will reveal you the wisdom on how 
    this attack works, the intensity of notoriety based on the various template types, 
    effective tips for preventing this attack and other such."

  Description: "Most information security tools and techniques focus on proactive and 
    reactive security measures to mitigate risk to information and information systems so 
    unauthorized parties cannot access, modify, or delete this data. After all, the field 
    is called ‘Information Security’. However, data security is only one aspect of the 
    equation. If a database is breached, such as during the Equifax data breach of 2017, 
    not only data is compromised or stolen, but this data may be associated with people 
    (data privacy), and then regulations such as CCPA, PCI, HIPAA, and GDPR come into 
    place.<br> 
    Does your data security assessment include data privacy?<br>
    Attendees will come away with an understanding of how to combine data privacy impact 
    assessment (DPIA) methodology with data security assessment to produce a more rigorous 
    and actionable toolset for management and weighing data privacy protections."

  Description: You’re tasked with ‘doing AppSec’ for your company and you’ve got more apps 
    and issues than you know how to deal with. How do you make sense of the different tools 
    with different outputs for all your different apps? DefectDojo can be your one source 
    of truth and become the heart of your AppSec automation program. DefectDojo grew out of 
    a Product Security program 7 years ago and was created by AppSec people for AppSec 
    people.  As you progress through this course, you'll learn how to deploy DefectDojo and 
    make the most of of the many features it offers including it's REST-based API. 
    DefectDojo can be your one source of truth for discovered security vulnerabilities, 
    report generation, aggregation of over 60 different security tools, inventory of 
    applications, tracking testing efforts and metrics on the AppSec program. DefectDojo 
    was the heart of an AppSec automation effort that saw an increase in assessments from 
    44 to 414 in two years.  Don't you want 9.4 times more output from your AppSec program?  
    It's time to ditch spreadsheets and get DefectDojo.
